# Recipe search

This project prompts the user for an ingredient and searches for recipes based on the user input. Results are saved to a .txt file.

It uses the Edamam Recipe API: https://www.edamam.com/


## Lessons Learned

- Making an API call

- Retrieving data from dictionaries and nested lists of dictionaries

- Saving output to a .txt file
  
## Roadmap

- Order the results by weight or another piece of data

- Ask the user additional questions to filter recipes

- Cross-reference the ingredient against the Edamam nutrition analysis API
